Everyone wants fast approvals, but reviewers need structure. Here is the checklist I expect before opening a pull request (PR).

{/* truncate */}

## Pre-flight

- Run `npm test` or your project''s default test command.
- Format files (`npm run lint`, `black`, `gofmt`, etc.).
- Update docs (README, tutorials, diagrams) if behavior changed.

## During review

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="author" label="Author">
    - Link related issues or research tasks.
    - Highlight risky areas (`@ reviewers please focus on ...`).
    - Attach screenshots/GIFs for UI work.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="reviewer" label="Reviewer">
    - Work in 400-line chunks.
    - Quote the line you are commenting on so the author knows the context.
    - When something is blocking, switch from *Comment* to *Request changes*.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## After merge

- Delete the feature branch locally and remotely.
- Note any follow-up tasks in GitHub Issues so they do not get lost.

Happy shipping!
