# Git & GitHub Tutorial Studio

Welcome to the place where we learn real-world version control with simple language and repeatable checklists.

> **Mahbub Hassan** · Graduate Student & Non ASEAN Scholar, Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.

## How to use this studio

1. **Follow the sections in order.** Each topic builds on the previous one and ends with a mini-checklist so you know when to move forward.
2. **Practice on a sandbox repository.** Create a folder named `lab-git` and use it to try every command shown here before touching production work.
3. **Keep a command log.** Open a Markdown file or Notion page where you paste commands that helped you solve problems. It becomes your personal cheat sheet.
4. **Share questions.** Raise GitHub issues or drop feedback so the tutorial keeps improving for the next cohort.

## What you will learn

- Install Git, set up SSH/HTTPS, and configure your identity the way top journals expect for reproducibility.
- Move comfortably between working tree ? staging area ? commits, and undo mistakes without panic.
- Create branches, collaborate through pull requests, and run code reviews with respectful but firm checklists.
- Publish documentation via GitHub Pages and wire up basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
