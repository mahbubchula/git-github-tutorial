# Welcome to the Git & GitHub Studio

Hi, I'm **Mahbub Hassan** - Graduate Student & Non ASEAN Scholar, Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. This studio is the fast lane my students use to learn version control without drowning in jargon.

## How the studio works

1. **Pick a module** in the sidebar. Each module ends with a mini checklist so you know you are ready.
2. **Practice inside a sandbox folder** called `lab-git`. Run every command there before touching a production repo.
3. **Record what you learn**. Keep a simple Markdown or Notion page with commands plus short notes.
4. **Share blockers**. Open a GitHub Discussion or email me when you get stuck; feedback improves the tutorial for the next cohort.

## What you will master

- Installing Git, configuring your identity, and authenticating with HTTPS or SSH.
- Making safe snapshots, undoing mistakes, and understanding the working tree -> staging -> history flow.
- Working with teammates through branches, pull requests, and polite code reviews.
- Shipping deliverables: tagged releases, GitHub Pages sites, and basic CI/CD with Actions.

Ready? Start with **Module 01 - Setup Confidence**.
